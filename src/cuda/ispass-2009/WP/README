WSM5 (WRF microphysics) test driver for host CPU and GPU, complete with test data sets.

To compile:
	Edit makefile for your system.  
           (Variables XXX and YYY control number of threads per block. See settings
            in makefile for settings for different GPUs)
	make
	(make clean also works)

	Makes 2 execs: wsm5_driver_vanilla (host cpu) and wsm5_driver_chocolate (gpu)

To run:
	CD to run and type runit
