Name : TestPackage

Description: A test for the Package class. TestPoints: 1) Add some 
             variables, copy the package, remove the variables, make sure that they 
             match. 2) Randomly add, remove, reserve, and compress the 
             package. Finally remove all variables and make sure that they match.
