pots: this contains potentials for the EAM potential

two types of tabular potentials are contained here and available from
http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~cbecker/Cu.html

(1) Cu_u6.eam uses the funcfl format to represent the Adams potential

diffusion of FCC metals using the 5-frequency model and the Embedded
 Atom Method," J. Mater. Res. 4, 102-112 (1989).

(2) Cu01.eam.alloy uses the setfl format to represent the Mishin potential.
Setfl is contained here for future representation of alloys
