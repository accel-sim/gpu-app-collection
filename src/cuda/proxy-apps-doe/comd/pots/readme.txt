pots: this contains potentials for the EAM potential

These potentials are described in a few different papers,
beginning with Ni and Al in Voter and Chen, 1987 [1].
The most complete description of the fitting procedure is
in a chapter in a book on intermetallics [2].  This complete
description can also be found in a Los Alamos technical
report, along with the parameters for all seven fcc
potentials [3].  This technical report and the original Voter-Chen
paper are now included with this potentials package as pdf files.
For the "cu" potential, please cite Ref. [4],
which gives the parameters and cites the earlier papers
(or, cite both Ref. [4] and Ref. [2]).
For the silver potential ("ag"), please cite Refs. [5] and [2].
For Pd, Pt, and Au, simply cite reference [3], or check with me
for whether it has since been published in the regular literature.
The cu1 and ag1 potentials are designed to work with each other
for Cu-Ag alloy simulations.  The cross potential is simply fit
to the heat of solution at infinite dilution for Cu in Ag and Ag in Cu.
As pure elements (cu1, ag1), they work exactly like the cu and ag pots.
These will be described in a paper (Sprague et al) that we think will
appear soon (writing this September of 2002) in Phys. Rev. B.
If you are uncertain about how to cite a particular
potential, don't hesitate to contact me.
Also, if you are worried that your potential files have become corrupted,
contact me for fresh ones.
