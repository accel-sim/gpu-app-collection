These are modifed version of rodinia 2.0 that can run quickly on GPGPU-Sim.
This was a work in progress when it was completed by graduate students at UBC and not all the applications have been
ported for functional verification.
Specifically, the following have functional test that are run by the fast regresstions:<br/>
<br/>
backprop<br/>
bfs<br/>
heartwall<br/>
hotspot<br/>
kmeans<br/>
lud<br/>
nn<br/>
nw<br/>
pathfinder<br/>
srad<br/>
streamcluster<br/>
<br/>
Since rodinia has since been updated many times since this original effort, there is no additional work planned to bring the whole suite up to date.
These tests exist today to serve as a minimum functional testing of GPGPU-Sim and it's configs.
