Survey Propagation

This version of LSG SP (`nsp') has been rewritten and has a
different interface. In particular, it no longer generates random
formulae -- this is now the task of a support program, `genformula'.

To execute it in a backwards-compatible manner, you must first `make
support' and then run `sp' as usual. This will generate a random
formula in a temporary file and then run nsp.sh which will attempt to
solve the formula using `nsp' and WalkSAT. The temporary file is not
removed.

You can also run `nsp' directly on CNF files. This version assumes
literals are numbered from 1 in the CNF files.  The LSG version also
does not detect contradictions, though it will fail with "UNCONVERGED"
error.  The top 1% of literals are decimated in every pass. 

Output is written to:
       sp_sol.dat: partial solution	
       partial.cnf: decimated CNF

Running `nsp.sh' is recommended, since this version will invoke
WalkSAT on partial.cnf and merge the results together. This is
optional. To interface to WalkSAT, download and compile sp-1.4b from
here:

http://users.ictp.it/~zecchina/SP/
(http://www.ictp.trieste.it/~zecchina/SP/sp-1.4b.tgz)

Create a symlink named sp-1.4 to the directory in
$LSGDIR/apps/sp/. Then run nsp through nsp.sh.

This emulates the behaviour of the original CPU implementation. It is
strongly recommended that you do this if you're developing SP.

Since SP is a heuristic, LSG SP only aims to be a faithful
implementation of the algorithm. Therefore, LSG SP should succeed
whenever CPU SP succeeds, and fail likewise.
