The LSG Single-Source Shortest Path implementation has several
variants.

sssp: A topology-driven, one node-per-thread version as in LSG 1.02

sssp-wln: A data-driven, one node-per-thread version

sssp-wlc: A data-driven, one edge-per-thread version using Merill's
	 strategy adapted to SSSP.

All variants write output to "sssp-output.txt" and use node 0 as the
starting node.

The fastest SSSP variant is currently sssp-wlc.
