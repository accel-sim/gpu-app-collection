NOTE!! -   The F(rho) interpolation array (ag3.f) has been replaced by
           a 7th-order polynomial fit to the F(Rho) that came out of apot25.
           The second deriv of the original F was very jumpy.
           e.g., See files  ag3fitf.mac, ag3.f.poly, ag3.f.save  ag3doit.

Also - a cross potential now exists with cu3.
see cu3.doc, cu3ag3 directory,...

Thus, the listing from apot25 below is not what this modified-F potential actually gives.

e.g.,  azero =  4.08903  (instead of 4.09)
       Ecoh  = -2.86025  (instead of -2.85)
